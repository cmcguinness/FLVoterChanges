Captures Demographic Changes to Florida's Voter Roles

## Introduction
This repository captures demographic changes as generated by my
AddSub program.  The demographic changes are found by comparing
voter roles in two months and detecting net new voters, deleted
voters, and voters who have changed party reigstration

## Files
The files are generally titled with the two months being compared.
The month represents the state of the voter rolls at the end
of the previous month (or at midnight of the first day of the
month listed, take your pick).

The files are in tab-delimited text format.  They should generally
open in Excel without any issues.

The column titles are generally self-describing.  At some point
I may document the precise meaning of them; in the mean time,
if you look at the 
[AddSub program](https://github.com/cmcguinness/AddSub)
 you can see how the data is generated

## Related Information

Every month I update a large google sheet with the data along with
interesting (to me, at least) analyses of the data.
